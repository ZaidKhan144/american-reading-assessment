## Task: Fix an Old Website ##

We have an old website that sorely needs to be updated. It's called "Pog Universe." Hey, we said it was old! 

Some suggestions on where to start:

* Are there any errors on this website that you can fix? 
* Can you update the site to be a little more modern? 
* Can you make it adhere to Section 508 Compliance standards?
* Extra Credit: Create a mockup in Figma that reflects the design. Share the URL for this mockup with hr@americanreading.com.
